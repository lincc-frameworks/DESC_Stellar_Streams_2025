Demos prepared for the Stellar Streams in LSST; DESC Dark Matter Workshop, 2025, Seattle, WA.
The noteboooks showcase working with HATS-partitioned survey catalogs via [LSDB](https://lsdb.io), and time domain analysis with [nested-pandas](https://nested-pandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Getting Started 

### On Rubin Science Platform

Make sure that you have access to the Rubin Science Platform and follow the instructions at [lsdb.io/dp1](https://lsdb.io/dp1).

For a complete guide to setting up an RSP account and getting custom versions of LSDB available in
your notebooks, we've put together a [system guide](/setup/) that you might find useful.

## [Notebooks](/tutorials/)

### [Notebook 1](/tutorials/Notebook_1_Intro.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will learn how to:

- Import DASK client
- Load object and source catalogs (lazily)
- Show HATS partitioning with ZTF objects and source
- Perform crossmatching with existing `LSDB` catalogs
- Save the results of a science workflow to disk

### [Notebook 2](/tutorials/Notebook_2_Intro.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will learn:

- How to access photo-z catalog derived from Rubin’s Data Preview 1 with LSDB 

### [Notebook 3](/tutorials/Notebook_3_Intro.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will learn:

- What nested pandas is
- How to do basic operations on timeseries

### [Notebook 4](/tutorials/Notebook_4_Intro.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will learn how to:

- Crossmatch custom list of positions
- Access Object and diaObject data from Rubin DP1
- Show lightcurves for both Objects and diaObjects

### [Notebook 5](/tutorials/Notebook_5_Intro.ipynb)

In this notebook, we provide several AGN-related problems:

- Crossmatch SDSS AGNs with Rubin DP1 photo-z catalog
- Crossmatch a large catalog of AGN with Rubin DP1 data
- Run scientific analysis on lightcurves from Rubin DP1
